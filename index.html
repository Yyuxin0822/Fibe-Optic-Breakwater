  <p class=h3>Environments as Engineered Systems</p>
  <p class=p--info>Hi! I am Yuxin Yang, a climate-positive and technology-savvy designer. I interface the
    built environment as an engineered system with a particular interest in the mega-infrastructure,
    mix-used development, and energy and water system. I decode the environmental processes by perceiving nature as a self-dynamic engine where water, 
    sediments, and vegetation vitally facilitate it. My technology expertise enables me to incorporate
    the knowledge of sensing technology and data visualization in design thinking. At or
    after work, Yuxin values opportunities to develop tools to facilitate the public engagement.</p>
    <p class=p--info>Yuxin now works full-time as an urban designer at Interbor Partners and part-time as a computationtal designer at Landau Design + Technology. 
    Previously, She has held a design practice or research position at SOM,
    SWA Group, URBANGENE, Zhuyufan Studio of Tsinghua University, and Shanghai Study
    Center of Hongkong University.</p>
    <p class=p--info>Yuxin holds a Master of Landscape Architecture from Harvard Graduate School of
    Design and cross-registered at MIT Media Lab and EECS during school. She has a Bachelor of
    Engineering from the School of Architecture, Southeast
    University, China.</p>
