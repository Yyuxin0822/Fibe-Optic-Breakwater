    <p class=h3>Environments as Engineered Systems</p>
    <p class=p--info>Hi! I am Yuxin Yang, a climate-positive and technology-savvy designer. I interface the
    built environment as an engineered system with a particular interest in the mega-infrastructure,
    mix-used development, and energy and water system. I decode the environmental processes by perceiving nature as a self-dynamic engine where water, 
    sediments, and vegetation vitally facilitate it. My technology expertise enables me to incorporate
    the knowledge of sensing technology and data visualization in design thinking. At or
    after work, I seek opportunities to develop tools to facilitate the public engagement.</p>
    <p class=p--info>I am currently employed as a full-time urban designer at Interboro Partners and a part-time computational designer at Landau Design + Technology.
    Previously, I worked in design firms or research institutions such as SOM,
    SWA Group, URBANGENE, Zhuyufan Studio of Tsinghua University, and Shanghai Study
    Center of Hongkong University.</p>
    <p class=p--info>I graduated from Harvard Graduate School of Design with a Master of Landscape Architecture 
        and cross-registered at MIT Media Lab and EECS during my studies. 
        I have a Bachelor of Engineering from Southeast University's School of Architecture in China.</p>
